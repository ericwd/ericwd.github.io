# Intro 
<!-- Just do a gallery of shrooms? -->

## Equipment

A laminar flow hood made from a blower fan and HEPA filter built into a cabinet.

To check if the filtered air was clean enough, I left one agar plate in front of the flow hood (clean) and another plate outside the hood (dirty) for about an hour. After a few days at ambient temperature, the dirty plate showed contamination but the clean  plate was spotless.

The clean area in front of the hood enables the sterile transfers of mycelium necessary to clone and propagate strains.

Chicken of the Woods. Found 2022-10-15.

It was an El Ni√±o year and we got a lot of rain, so I found lots of mushrooms in the park during the Spring. See my iNaturalist [Year in Review 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/stats/2023/laserjock29979) for this year's observations.

# Resources

Good books and websites.
